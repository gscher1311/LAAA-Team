    "description": "The LAAA Team is proud to present 2341 Beach Ave, a fully renovated 3-unit coastal triplex in Venice's Silver Triangle, one of the most desirable micro-neighborhoods on Los Angeles's Westside. The property consists of a 1921 single-family bungalow in front and a 1977 rear duplex, both comprehensively renovated in 2016-2017 with all permits finaled and a Certificate of Occupancy issued. All three units are currently leased at market rents totaling $11,600/month ($139,200 annually), with a blended rent of $6.83/SF.",
    "description_continued": "The unit mix comprises one 2BR/1BA (700 SF) and two 1BR/1BA (499 SF each), all featuring in-unit washer/dryers, stainless steel appliances, mini-split HVAC, laminated waterproof flooring, skylights, soundproof walls, and French doors opening to a shared patio. The property operates as a documented legal nonconforming triplex in the R1-1-O zone, supported by a complete chain of City permits, a Certificate of Occupancy, Coastal Exemption approval, and RSO registration.",
    "location_paragraph": "Venice's Silver Triangle sits blocks from Abbot Kinney Boulevard, Venice Beach, and the Venice Canals. The neighborhood commands a Walk Score of 83 and is served by Metro bus lines along Lincoln and Venice Boulevards. Silicon Beach employers including Google, Snap, and Amazon maintain offices within 2-3 miles, driving consistent demand from high-income renters. Median household income in Venice exceeds $125,000, placing it in the 97th percentile nationally.",

The subject's fully renovated condition justifies pricing at or above this benchmark. The most comparable same-street sale is 2318 Beach Ave ($917K/unit, 4.97% cap), which sets the ceiling for the corridor but reflects a larger, townhouse-style building. The 2428 Ocean Ave comp ($647K/unit, 6.19% cap) provides a realistic floor for quality Venice triplexes.

At $1,995,000, the subject is positioned as the most competitively priced renovated triplex in the Venice market, capturing buyers filtering under the $2M threshold. The most relevant active comp is 24 20th Ave at $1,950,000 ($650K/unit) with 66 DOM despite a walk-street location.
