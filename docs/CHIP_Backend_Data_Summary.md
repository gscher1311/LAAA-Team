## Notes for Implementation

1. **Program Selection Logic:**
   - Check Transit Oriented eligibility first (T-1, T-2, T-3)
   - Then Opportunity Corridor (OC-1, OC-2, OC-3)
   - Then Corridor Transition (CT zones)
   - State Density Bonus as baseline comparison
   - AHIP for 80%+ affordable projects

2. **Stacking Rules:**
   - MIIP and AHIP cannot be combined with each other
   - State Density Bonus is baseline; MIIP/AHIP provide additional
   - Public Benefit Options can stack with Additional Incentives

3. **Key Inputs Needed:**
   - Parcel address/APN
   - Lot size (SF)
   - Base zoning
   - Distance to Major Transit Stop
   - TCAC Opportunity Area designation
   - Market Area (for AHLF fees)

4. **Calculations to Perform:**
   - Base density (units by-right)
   - Bonus density per program
   - Max FAR per program
   - Max height per program
   - Required affordable units per program
   - Parking requirements per program
